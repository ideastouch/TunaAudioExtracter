TunaPlayer is a program that lets you dump audio from video files. The gui should be easy to figure out.

To compile the program you will need the gstreamer and gtkmm devel packages as well ass gcc, gcc++ and gnu make. Get them from your distro. When you have all the tools and libraries, compile with 'make' and run the program with ./tunaplayer

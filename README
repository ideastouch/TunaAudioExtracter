Tuna Audio Extracter is a program that lets you dump audio from video files. The gui should be easy to figure out.

To compile the program you will need the gstreamer and gtkmm devel packages as well ass gcc, gcc++ and gnu make. Get them from your distro. You should also get all gstreamer plugins so you can decode media files and codecs. When you have all the tools, libraries and plugins, compile with 'make' and run the program with ./tae
